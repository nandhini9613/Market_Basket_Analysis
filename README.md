This project uses the **Apriori algorithm** to discover association rules from transactional data.

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset contains a list of transactions where each row represents a customer purchase.  
Each transaction consists of items bought together.


## ðŸš€ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Applying **Apriori Algorithm** to find frequent itemsets
- Generating **association rules** (support, confidence, lift)
- Visualization of frequent patterns and item relationships

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements
Install the required dependencies before running the project:
```bash
pip install pandas mlxtend matplotlib seaborn
